# Binary Tree Viewer

A program displaying a binary tree on the screen.
State : unfinished. Minimal functionnalities.

Made with SFML 2.5.
For now one can enter the values of the binary tree inside the main function.
It accepts any type for which `std::to_string()` is overloaded.

Potential future additions:
- read tree values from a file.
- enter values in the program (UI)
- pluggable custom value-to-string converter
